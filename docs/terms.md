#Terms Used

Since amanuensis plans to be cross system it abstracts some game 
concepts into more general ones to implement. They are listed here 
with a descriotion and some examples from games.

Stat - A numerical value that is derived from one or many different 
sources with or without bonuses. In d20 Strength, Dexterity, toHit etc. 
Inside Amanuensis there is no such thing as a non-derived stat(called 
attributes in some systems.) They are just derived stats with only one 
contibuting factor.

Mod -  Any number which contributes to the value of a stat. In d20, 
ability bonuses, ehnantment bonuses and such are examples, but so is 
the 10 base value for AC.

Mod-Type -  A description of the source of a mod. It is expected 
that if multiple Mods of the same Mod-Type apply to the same Stat 
only the largest is counted.
